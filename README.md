#### Knowledge Gained During the Processü§ì

- Set up ESLint along with Prettier to perform static analysis of your code during development;

- Write a test for a React component;

- Use query functions like getByText, getAllByRole, and queryByText;

- Perform snapshot testing;

- Use userEvent() to simulate user interactions with the page;

- Better organize your tests by using describe() to add a general description for your tests;

- Test components that receive props;

- Ensure that your list components display dynamic data and not static HTML in your code;

- Stub function behaviors;

- Test events with onSubmit, which is triggered when submitting form data;

- Mock a function with jest.fn();

- Test functions that are part of your business logic, such as a function that calculates a new balance;

- Write tests with stubbed functions and start thinking of new features for your application even before they are implemented;

- Had your first contact with TDD, which stands for Test Driven Development, and can be understood as Test-Oriented Development;

- How to write better tests with good practices and clear language;

- How to protect your production application from untested code that has been added to your app;

- How to create tests to verify if everything is correct with the application's routes;

- How to use BrowserRouter and MemoryRouter to work with React routes in the testing environment;

- That it‚Äôs possible to test hooks from react-router-dom to test components that depend on them;

- How to write integration tests between two components of the application;
